**CleanSquare Robotics** is an early stage technology startup specializing in navigation and operation technology that makes utility vehicles fully autonomous. Our initial focus is on street sweeping vehicles, which we are equipping with sensors and specialised software to make street sweeping in pedestrian areas fully autonomous and automated.
